    1. What were the four commands you used to assemble, compile, link, and run in the "Compiling and Assembling" section?
        gcc -Wall -Wpedantic -std=c17 -march=haswell -c array_sum.S 
        gcc -Wall -Wpedantic -std=c17 -march=haswell -c array_sum_speed.c 
        gcc -Wall -Wpedantic -std=c17 -march=haswell array_sum.o array_sum_speed.o 
        ./a.out 10000
    2. What was the first command you used to compile array_sum.c? How must faster/slower was your C implementation compared to the provided assembly?
        gcc -Wall -Wpedantic -std=c17 -march=haswell array_sum.c array_sum_speed.c
        
        Compare to the compliing with assembly and object files, which was avarage 45,000 cycles, compling it with C implementation took so much longer which was around 325,000 cycles. (see below for more exact result)

    3. How did the speed of the C and assembly implementations of array_sum compare after you added -O3 to the compilation command? How did C speed compare with and without -O3?
        
        When it is complied with -O3 tag, the number of cycles avarage was around 1,338 - 2,195 cycles which is incredibly smaller than when it is complied without the tag, which was around 325,000 cycles. 


The below are the test result:
